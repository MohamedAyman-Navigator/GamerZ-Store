## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   Python 3.8 or higher
*   Microsoft SQL Server (Local or Remote instance)
*   ODBC Driver 18 for SQL Server
*   Google Gemini API Key

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/MohamedAyman-Navigator/GamerZ-Store.git
    cd GamerZ-Store
    ```

2.  **Create a Virtual Environment**
    ```bash
    python -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3.  **Install Dependencies**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Database Setup**
    *   Ensure SQL Server is running.
    *   Create a database named `Gamerz__db`.
    *   Update the `DB_CONFIG` dictionary in `app.py` with your server credentials:
        ```python
        DB_CONFIG = {
            "DRIVER": "{ODBC Driver 18 for SQL Server}",
            "SERVER": "localhost",
            "DATABASE": "Gamerz__db",
            "UID": "your_username",
            "PWD": "your_password",
        }
        ```
    *   *Note: Ensure your database schema matches the application's expected tables (`users`, `games`, `orders`, etc.).*
    *   **Initialize the Database**: Run the provided `schema.sql` script in SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) or via `sqlcmd` to create the database and tables.

5.  **Seed the Database**
    *   Populate your store with real game data from Steam by running the import script:
        ```bash
        python import_steam.py
        ```

6.  **Configure AI API**
    *   Open `app.py` and replace the placeholder with your API key:
        ```python
        GEMINI_API_KEY = "YOUR_GOOGLE_GEMINI_API_KEY"
        ```

### Running the Application

```bash
python app.py
```
The application will start at `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.
